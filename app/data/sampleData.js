Setting up shop in New Orleans, the brilliant Dr. West continues his life's work: the revival of the dead by purely chemical means. To accomplish this task, he recruits Susan Greene, a young and wide-eyed pharmacologist fascinated by his macabre experiments. Initially unfazed by West's unorthodox practices (including how he funds his research - by selling zombie brain fluid as a narcotic), Susan may regret her scientific curiosity as sinister forces - those aligned with Elder Gods and Haitian Voodoo - begin to align against the Reanimator! Dynamite Entertainment proudly resurrects The Reanimator, H.P Lovecraft's notorious mad scientist, in a fear-fraught four-issue miniseries!\n\nTake what you love best about the television shows \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Walking Dead\", throw in Cthulhu tentacle terror and backwater Louisianan superstition, and you have the all-new horror comic hit of 2015!",

A man appears with no background, no memory, and no place to call home. But he has powers. Powers that seem resemble those we learned about in Sunday School. Could it be?! Is it possible that this man is much, much more than that? Is it possible that he is our \"SAVIOR\" in the flesh? And if he is, then why doesn't he know who he is or how he got his powers? Strip away the spandex and trappings of the traditional comic superhero and ask yourself a simple question: \"How would I react if GOD suddenly appeared in front of me, but everything we had been taught about him seems out of whack?\" What you would have left, beyond your own doubts, is the presence of a man who has to deal with the fact that his appearance in the world is seen as both a blessing and a curse. Some will see him as a hero, a messiah. Other will see him as an enemy because there isn't room for a person with god-like powers to disrupt the status quo of what we already believe. Some will rally behind him. Others will denounce him. But none of us will be able to ignore him.",

Turf wars, breaking rules, crushing violence, and Black Flag - these are a few of our favorite things, and we can't wait for Curb Stomp to straight-up knock our teeth out (in a good way). \n\nWHY YOU'LL LOVE IT: Writer Ryan Ferrier (D4VE) is a creator on the rise, and newcomer Devaki Neogi's art will hook you with its aggressiveness but keep you coming back with its heart. Curb Stomp is an unflinching, visceral look at the lengths one woman will go to protect her friends, her family, and her home-perfect for fans of Rat Queens and the seminal '70s cult-favorite film The Warriors. \n\nWHAT IT'S ABOUT: Three gangs. Five girls. No way out. Machete Betty leads a small gang of women under the self-appointed task of protecting their home of Old Beach, one of three boroughs surrounding a rich metropolitan city. When Betty takes the life of a rival gang member in an act of self-defense, she sets off a chain reaction of retaliation, gang warfare, and unlikely allies. It's up to the The Fever -- Machete Betty, Derby Girl, Bloody Mary, Daisy Chain, and Violet Volt -- to defend their turf at all costs.",

Turf wars, breaking rules, crushing violence, and Black Flag - these are a few of our favorite things, and we can't wait for Curb Stomp to straight-up knock our teeth out (in a good way). WHY YOU'LL LOVE IT: Writer Ryan Ferrier (D4VE) is a creator on the rise, and newcomer Devaki Neogi's art will hook you with its aggressiveness but keep you coming back with its heart. Curb Stomp is an unflinching, visceral look at the lengths one woman will go to protect her friends, her family, and her home-perfect for fans of Rat Queens and the seminal '70s cult-favorite film The Warriors. WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Three gangs. Five girls. No way out. Machete Betty leads a small gang of women under the self-appointed task of protecting their home of Old Beach, one of three boroughs surrounding a rich metropolitan city. When Betty takes the life of a rival gang member in an act of self-defense, she sets off a chain reaction of retaliation, gang warfare, and unlikely allies. It's up to the The Fever -- Machete Betty, Derby Girl, Bloody Mary, Daisy Chain, and Violet Volt -- to defend their turf at all costs.",
